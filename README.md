# Ames---Linear-Regression

## Code
[Ames - LR](https://github.com/Sharma-Amol/Ames---Linear-Regression/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20Project%20Exercise%20%5BFinal%5D.ipynb)

## Context
The goal is to create a Linear Regression Model, train it on the data with the optimal parameters using a grid search, and then evaluate the model's capabilities on a test set.
Dataset for this exercise will be the final version of the Ames Housing dataset I worked on through the feature engineering section of the course. 

This exercise and the associated dataset were provided as part of the excellent course 'Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass' by Jose Portilla on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/), which I successfully completed.
